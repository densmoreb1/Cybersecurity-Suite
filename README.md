# Cybersecurity Suite

This is for learning purposes only. There are already tools out there similar to the ones I created. 

I created an application that is supposed to be a learning environment for people to see how some of the more advanced tools work.

Have caution running any of the scripts that involve scanning a network, encrypting, or running malware.

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    This will install some dependencies such as PysimpleGUI, pyinstaller, cyrptography
3. Run python3 app.py 
4. Follow the instructions
