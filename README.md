# Cybersecurity Suite
### Brandon Densmore
## Purpose
 
The purpose of this project is to teach me more about cybersecurity and all the things that come with it. Programming, networking, and operating systems.

I plan to create a small suite of scripts that will have two differnt purposes. Half be used to gather information about a target. The other half will be used to attack a target.

## Background / Prior Knowledge

I have very little background with cybersecurity. The field of cybersecurity I am interested in includes a lot of networking, programming, and knowlege about the three main operating systems, linux, MacOS, and Windows. I know a little bit about networking which will most likely have the steepest learning curve. I know a lot about programming, and a medium amount of operating systems.

## Description

<!-- Why -->
The purpose of this project will be for me and others to gain a better understand on certain concepts and tools used by penetration testers. Some of the tools can be hard to understand what they are doing and I hope to create an enviroment that will be easy to understand. Whoever is using this is interested in learning how to use the production tools. 

<!-- What -->
I will be creating my own suite of applications or scripts that will do two important things when conducting a pentest. Information gathering and exploitation. Another thing it will do is teach the user how to use the real tools in a bigger enviroment. My suite will be a learning enviroment for people new to pentesting. 

<!-- Who -->
The people that will be using this will be people who are new to pentesting. They don't have any knowlege about the tools used to conduct information gathering or exploitation. But they are interested in learning them. I will provide a simple interface that will explain what the scripts are doing and how they can be helpful when conducting a pentest.

<!-- Where -->
I will developing this in Visual Studio Code. I will create an simple application that will give the user the option of learning a certain amount of tools.

<!-- How -->
The user will run one application that will then call other scripts.

<!-- When -->
The first couple of weeks will be me researching and seeing what I can do in python and with the given time period. The next phase will be creating the interface for the initial application. Then, I will add different scripts to the application to be called and have the user interact with them.
