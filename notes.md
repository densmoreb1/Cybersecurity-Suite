### Info Gathering script ideas
- network scanner
- find ip address of a website
- test strength of password

### Exploitation script ideas
- send phising emails
    - could use machine learning to put together an email that looks similar to a compnay the user inputs
- create a program that will display cat pictures every 5 seconds
- keylogger
- randsomeware


## main GUI
- get rid of scroll bar ✔️
- set up instructions ✔️
- possibly split up scripts into 2 different boxes
- change colors?

### ip address GUI
- make it more interactive
- have a pop up window that explains how ip addresses work, with maybe a question at the end?
- after they use the input, give them a command that can do it on linux

- path to demos
/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniforge/base/envs/hack/lib/python3.10/site-packages/psgdemos/demo_programs/
