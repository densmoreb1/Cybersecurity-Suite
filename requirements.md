# Cybersecurity Suite

## Section 1

Description and Architecture

The purpose of this project is for me to learn more about cybersecurity practices. In order to write software meant for cybersecurity, I need to understand the principles behind it. Throughout the project, I will be attending the CSA (Cybersecurity Association) meetings to learn more and apply the things learned.

## Section 2a

The project will include 1 app. The app will include the other smaller gui's that will demonstrate different principles.

Altogether, the project will contain 6 scripts. Each script will explore a different aspect of cybersecurity. 3 will be about information gathering and the other 3 will be about exploitation. Each script will have simple gui involved to make it easy to use. 

1. Docker Container

- The app will contained in a docker image and container, where people can pull the image and run it without worrying about dependencies

2. Look up Ip Address

- This will have an input box for a website which will return the ip address of that website

3. Network Scanner

- The user will have the ability to enter an ip address and scan the ports and will return the port number and what is being run on that port
- This one will scan the ports but most websites or machines have firewalls so there will not be a lot of information

4. Passwords

- The user will have two options. They can enter the password that they are using and the app will return how long it would take to crack. The user can also ask for a strong randomized password

5. Cat Pictures

- This script will be a fun script that when run on a machine, it will display cat pictures randomly and it will be difficult to remove

6. Randsomware

- This script will go through files in a directory and encrypt the files and can only be opened with a password

7. Keylogger

- The user can send a file over to a machine that when opened it will run a background process that will send key presses to the other machine.

## Section 2b
1. Subdomain enumerator
- This will find domains or routes that can be used to traverse a website that should not be seen by a normal user
2. Hashcracker
- Find the hashing algorithm used to hash a password and unhash it

## Section 3

When the user runs the program, they will be greeted with the different options discussed above.

The experience will be involving and the user will be able to learn about what the scripts are doing. 

## Section 4

I will demo the app through screen recording. 

1. Open the app through an executable
2. The app will explain what the user can do and how to do it
3. Clicking on the program to run will run the program in another window
4. The new program will include instructions for the user to follow
5. The user will learn about cybersecurity practices
