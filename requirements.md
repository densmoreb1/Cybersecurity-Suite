# Cybersecurity Suite

## Section 1

Description and Architecture

The purpose of this project is for me to learn more about cybersecurity practices. In order to write software meant for cybersecurity, I need to understand the principles behind it. Throughout the project, I will be attending the CSA (Cybersecurity Association) meetings to learn more and apply the things learned.

## Section 2a

The project will include 1 app. The app will include the other smaller gui's that will demonstrate different principles.

Altogether, the project will contain 6 sctips. Each script will explore a different aspect of cybersecurity. 3 will be about information gathering and the other 3 will be about exploitation. Each script will have simple gui involved to make it easy to use. 

At the end of the project, I will create an executable for Windows and Mac.

### Info Gathering
1. Look up Ip Address

- This will have an input box for a website which will return the ip address of that website

2. Network Scanner

- The user will have the ability to enter an ip address and scan the ports and will return the port number and what is being run on that port

3. Passwords

- The user will have two options. They can enter the password that they are using and the app will return how long it would take to crack. The user can also ask for a strong randomized password

### Exploitation
1. Cat Pictures

- This script will be a fun script that when run on a machine, it will display cat pictures randomly and it will be difficult to remove

2. Randsomware

- This script will go through files in a directory and encrypt the files and can only be opened with a password

3. Keylogger

- The user can send a file over to a machine that when opened it will run a background process that will send key presses to the other machine.

## Section 2b

A stretch goal I have is another exploitation script. The script will have the option of writing an email that sounds like it is coming from a company that the user enters. I hope to make this one more complicated that the others. The email will be written by machine learning and include logos and such from the specific compnay.


## Section 3

At the end of everything the program, will be a simple .exe program. When the user runs the program, they will be greeted with the different options discussed above.


The experience will be involving and the user will be able to learn about what the scripts are doing.
